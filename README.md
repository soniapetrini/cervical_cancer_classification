# cervical_cancer_classification

The purpose of this work is to identify the most accurate and sensitive test for the diagnosis of cervical cancer, which is a relevant and urgent issue given the need for a prompt result, and the monetary and time costs. To address it, we will exploit supervised learning techniques for classification with four different target tests. Schillerâ€™s test will prove to yield the best predictor for the presence of cervical cancer.
